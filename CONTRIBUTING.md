# Contributing

Install Node 24 and pnpm 11, then run `pnpm install`. Before opening a pull
request, run `pnpm verify`.

## Package releases

The four published packages use the same version. A release updates and
publishes all four together.

The pull request title determines the release:

- `fix:` creates a patch release.
- `feat:` creates a minor release.
- `feat!:` and other titles containing `!` create a major release.
- `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `build:`, and `ci:` do not create a release.

Use a clear title because it is also used in the changelog. Pull requests are
squash merged so the validated title becomes the commit on `main`.

After a releasable pull request merges, Release Please opens or updates a
release pull request containing the shared version and changelog changes.
Merging it publishes all four packages to GitHub Packages after CI passes.
