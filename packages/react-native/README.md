# @valence/react-native

This is the React Native half of the Valence design system: a genuinely separate codebase from `@valence/react` that shares the design tokens and the `@valence/types` prop contracts with it. Components use platform-native behavior where it materially improves reliability, while Valence owns their public contracts, theming, and visual treatment.

## Fonts

The real Geist font files live in `@valence/tokens`'s `fonts/` directory, and this package loads them via `expo-font`. Call `useValenceFonts()` from your app's root and don't render your actual UI until it resolves to `true` — native has no font-fallback swap the way web's `font-display: swap` gives it one, so until the fonts finish loading, text renders silently in the OS's system font, with no error or warning to catch it. Gating the render on this hook is what makes that guaranteed rather than incidental:

```tsx
import { useValenceFonts } from '@valence/react-native/useValenceFonts';

function App() {
  const fontsLoaded = useValenceFonts();
  if (!fontsLoaded) return null; // or a real loading state
  return <YourApp />;
}
```

Components reference the loaded weights by their exact family name — `Geist-SemiBold`, `Geist-Bold`, `GeistMono-SemiBold`, and so on — through the registry in `fonts.ts`, because React Native selects between static font files by family name rather than resolving a `fontWeight` value against a single variable font the way CSS does. If you add a component that needs a weight not already in that registry, add it there rather than writing the family-name string inline; that registry is meant to be the one place those strings live.

## App root

`BottomSheet` uses Gorhom's native sheet implementation. Install the package's native peers and mount their providers once at the app root:

```tsx
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import { BottomSheetModalProvider } from '@gorhom/bottom-sheet';
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <SafeAreaProvider>
        <BottomSheetModalProvider>
          <YourApp />
        </BottomSheetModalProvider>
      </SafeAreaProvider>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
```

## Sizing and touch targets

Every interactive control in this package enforces a real minimum touch target, sized to comfortably clear the larger of the two major mobile platforms' own recommended minimums, so a single value works safely as a floor on both iOS and Android. That value, along with a handful of other native-specific control dimensions like field height and the slider handle size, is authored as a token the same way color and spacing are — the source to change if any of them ever need adjusting.

## Reduced motion

The package uses one internal reduced-motion hook to subscribe to React Native's `AccessibilityInfo` setting. It is an implementation detail rather than public API; components use it to skip nonessential animation and press-scale feedback consistently.
